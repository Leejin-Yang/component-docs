# Flex Component

The `Flex` component is a utility component that you can use to control layout with CSS flexbox. It exposes properties to control the direction, wrapping behavior, alignment, and spacing of its children.

## Props

- **direction**: Controls the direction of the flex items. Equivalent to CSS `flex-direction`.
- **wrap**: Controls whether the flex items are forced onto one line or can wrap onto multiple lines. Equivalent to CSS `flex-wrap`.
- **justify**: Defines how space is distributed between and around content items along the main-axis of a flex container. Equivalent to CSS `justify-content`.
- **alignContent**: Aligns a flex container's lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis. Equivalent to CSS `align-content`.
- **alignItems**: Defines how space is distributed between and around flex items along the cross-axis of their container. Equivalent to CSS `align-items`.
- **gap**: Defines size of gap between grid rows & columns.
- **width** / **height**: The width and height properties are used in many contexts by various other components.

## Usage

```jsx live
<Flex direction='row' justify='space-between'>
  <Flex.Item grow={1}>I grow</Flex.Item>
  <Flex.Item>I don't</Flex.Item>
</Flex>
```

# FlexItem Component

The `FlexItem` component is used as a child of a parent `Flex`. It exposes properties for controlling order, growth, shrinkage, basis size and alignment.

## Props

- **order**: Controls the order in which this item appears amongst its siblings.
- **grow** / **shrink** : Determines how much this item should grow or shrink relative to other flexible items in its parent container.
- **basis** : Specifies an optimal size for an elementâ€™s main axis dimension (width or height).

## Usage

```jsx live
<Flex direction='row' justify='space-between'>
  <Flex.Item grow={1}>I grow</Flex.Item>
  <Flex.Item>I don't</Flex.Item>
</Flex>
```
